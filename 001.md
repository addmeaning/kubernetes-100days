  * Azure Container Service (AKS)
  * A managed Kubernetes on Azure
  * access and manage your cluster through "az aks" and "kubectl"
  * an Azure-hosted control plane, automated upgrades, self-healing, easy scaling, and a simple user experience
  * a fully managed Kubernetes container orchestration service or choose other orchestrators
  * deployment, management, and operations of Kubernetes
  * a container hosting environment
  * create, configure, and manage a cluster of virtual machines that are preconfigured to run containerized applications
  * deploy and manage container-based applications on Microsoft Azure
  * Kubernetes and the Docker image format
  * Creating a Kubernetes cluster using Azure Container Service (AKS)
  * expose the standard Kubernetes API endpoints
  * AKS reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing a Kubernetes cluster by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure
  * a hosted Kubernetes service
  * Automated Kubernetes version upgrades and patching
  * Easy cluster scaling
  * Self-healing hosted control plane (masters)
  * Cost savings - pay only for running agent pool nodes
  * AKS does not provide direct access (such as with SSH) to the cluster
