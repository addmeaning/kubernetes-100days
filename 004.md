## Notes

### Kubernetes Engine Quickstart

[Kubernetes Engine Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart)

* Google Cloud Shell is a shell environment for managing resources hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Cloud Shell comes preinstalled with the gcloud and kubectl command-line tools.
* gcloud provides the primary command-line interface for GCP, and kubectl provides the command-line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters.

### Google Cloud SDK

* `gcloud config list`
* `gcloud config get-value project`
* `gcloud config set project`
* `gcloud compute zones list`
* `gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west3-a`

### Creating a Kubernetes Engine cluster using gcloud

* A cluster consists of at least one cluster master machine and multiple worker machines called nodes. Nodes are Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances that run the Kubernetes processes necessary to make them part of the cluster. You deploy applications to clusters, and the applications run on the nodes.
* Enable Google Kubernetes Engine API
* `gcloud container clusters create hello-k8s`
  * Automatically configures `kubectl` to use the cluster
* `gcloud container clusters list`
* `kubectl get nodes`
* `gcloud container clusters upgrade`
* `gcloud container clusters resize hello-k8s --size=0`

### Install Google Cloud SDK

[Install the Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-macos) (with `gcloud` command-line tool)

```
$ python -V
Python 2.7.10
